## **[Verse 1]**

```
F#m             C#
Lost in the quiet night
         D               Bm
I’m searching for a song inside
F#m            C#
Holding my breath so tight
       D                   Bm
I’m hoping for a burst of light

F#m                C#
Praying for a sign above
       D              Bm
When the walls around me feel so rough
F#m             C#
Waiting for the love to glow
  D                    Bm
And carry me where I should go
```

*(**Note:** Strumming can be moderate, with a slight build toward the Pre-Chorus. Keep it airy and open.)*

---

## **[Pre-Chorus]**

```
G                A
  And every time I close my eyes
F#m              E
  I see a spark across the sky
G                 A
  I’m ready now to take that ride
F#m             E
  Open my heart, let heaven align

---

## **[Chorus]**

```
D               E
  You’re my light upon the water
      F#m           C#
  When my faith is sinking fast
D                E
  You remind me I’m a daughter/son
      F#m               C#
  Of a promise meant to last
D                  E
  Shine through all the shadows
     F#m               C#
  Let your mercy see me through
D          E
  I surrender to the wonder
      F#m            C#
  Of a love I never knew
```

> *Big, open strums or a pulsing groove here—this is your “hook.” Feel free to add a melodic guitar or synth line to fill out the texture.*

---

## **[Verse 2]**

```
F#m           C#
Some days the clouds don’t break
     D                    Bm
I’m trembling at every small mistake
F#m           C#
But in the stillness, I can feel
   D                   Bm
A grace that speaks what’s truly real

F#m           C#
All of the burdens fade
     D              Bm
When I believe in brighter days
F#m                C#
I’ll climb this mountain high
     D                  Bm
‘Cause hope has taught me how to fly
```

---

## **[Pre-Chorus] (repeat the same progression)**

```
G                A
  I feel the sunrise in my soul
F#m              E
  A gentle whisper making me whole
G                 A
  You lift me up, I lose control
F#m             E
  Let this anthem echo below
```

---

## **[Chorus] (repeat)**
*Same chords, with possible slight melodic variation or additional vocal harmony for added impact.*

---

## **[Bridge]**

```
Bm                   D
  Even in the darkest night
         F#m          C#
I can hear the angels cry
Bm                      D
  “Keep on rising, keep on shining bright”
F#m                 C#
  Until we see the morning light
Bm                    D
  Every tear is turned to gold
F#m              C#
  In the promise that we hold
        Bm
We stand together
       D
We sing forever
      F#m                C#
And love will never let us go
```

> *Consider a soft breakdown leading into a powerful final chorus. Or add a brief instrumental break on these chords before returning to the chorus.*

---

## **[Chorus] (final time)**
*(Play with big energy; possibly repeat twice.)*

```
D               E
  You’re my light upon the water
      F#m           C#
  When my faith is sinking fast
D                E
  You remind me I’m a daughter/son
      F#m               C#
  Of a promise meant to last
D               E
  Shine through all the shadows
     F#m               C#
  Let your mercy see me through
D          E
  I surrender to the wonder
      F#m            C#
  Of a love I never knew

     (end big on)
D     E     F#m     C#
```

---

## **[Outro]**

```
F#m      C#        D      Bm
(Softly)   Oh, light upon the water
F#m      C#        D      Bm
           Oh, carry me farther
F#m      C#        D      Bm
           Let me rest in wonder
F#m      C#        D
           I’m safe in your arms
```

> *Fade out gently with a repeated motif or single notes on piano/guitar.*  

---

### **Strumming Suggestions**  
- **Verse & Intro**: Use gentle, steady down-strums or arpeggios on each chord. Build dynamics toward the pre-chorus.  
- **Pre-Chorus**: Increase energy—slightly faster down-strums, possibly eight-note strums or layered instruments.  
- **Chorus**: Go big—full down-strums or a mix of down-up strums, accenting beats 2 & 4 for that driving Coldplay feel.  
- **Bridge**: Could do a breakdown with single strums, then build back up.  

---

### **Vocal & Production Tips**  
- **Vocal Delivery**: Aim for sincerity and warmth in the verses. Let the chorus soar.  
- **Instrument Layers**: Add a sparse piano or subtle synth pad in the verses; build with a fuller band (guitar, bass, drums) for the chorus.  
- **Lead Guitar/Hook**: A chiming, reverb-heavy melodic line on top of the chorus can help it stand out.  
- **Backing Vocals**: Layer “oohs” or harmonies in the pre-chorus and final chorus to capture that signature epic Coldplay vibe.  

---

**Feel free** to adjust wording, chord voicings, or the key to best fit your vocal range and style. This structure—combining a reflective verse, a build-up pre-chorus, and a triumphant chorus—draws inspiration from the anthemic, spiritual, and uplifting qualities you highlighted, creating a fresh yet familiar Coldplay-like sound.

Enjoy crafting your new track!

We have **4 lines**, each line lasts about **2 measures** (8 beats).

1. **G**  
   “And **ev** - ’ry time I close my eyes”

---

## **[Chorus]** (8 measures)

Progression for the **Chorus** is:  
**D → E → F#m → C#** (each chord = 1 measure/4 beats)

Each line is about 1 measure, but you’ll **stretch** the lyric across 2 measures total. Here’s how you can space it:

1. **D**  
   “You’re my **light** up - on the wa - ter”  
   - *Melody idea*:  
     - Attack “light” strongly on D or F#

2. **E**  
   “When my **faith** is sink - ing fast”  
   - *Melody idea*:
     - Hit “faith” a step or third above previous note

   “Of a **prom** - ise meant to last”  
   - *Melody idea*:  
     - Soar up on “prom-ise”  
     - Resolve on “to last” (C# or E♯)  

*(Continue for the next 4 lines of the chorus, same chord progression.)*

5. **D**  
   “Shine **through** all the shad - ows”

6. **E**  
   “Let your **mer** - cy see me through”

7. **F#m**  
   “I **sur** - ren - der to the won - der”

8. **C#**  
   “Of a **love** I nev - er knew”

> **Vocals**: Bring more energy here. Each chord generally gets 4 beats, but the melody can flow across the bar line.  

---

## **[Verse 2]** (Same progression & timing as Verse 1)

Repeat the exact chord cycle: **F#m → C# → D → Bm**.

Use a similar or slightly varied melody. You can climb a bit higher in certain spots for variety or add small decorative notes:

1. **F#m**  
   “Some **days** the clouds don’t break”  
2. **C#**  
   “I’m **trem** - bling at every small mis - take”  
3. **D**  
   “But **in** the still - ness, I can feel”  
4. **Bm**  
   “A **grace** that speaks what’s tru - ly real”  

5. **F#m**  
   “All **of** the bur - dens fade”  
6. **C#**  
   “When I **be** - lieve in bright - er days”  
7. **D**  
   “I’ll **climb** this moun - tain high”  
8. **Bm**  
   “’Cause **hope** has taught me how to fly”  

---

## **[Pre-Chorus]** (again)

Same as before: **G → A → F#m → E**.

1. **G**  
   “I **feel** the sun - rise in my soul”  
2. **A**  
   “A **gen** - tle whis - per mak - ing me whole”  
3. **F#m**  
   “You **lift** me up, I lose con - trol”  
4. **E**  
   “**Let** this an - them ech - o be - low”  

---

## **[Chorus]** (repeat)

Same chords: **D → E → F#m → C#** (2 times through, 8 lines total). 

**Consider** adding a harmony or stronger backing vocals here. You might belt the final lines or do melodic runs.

---

## **[Bridge]** (8 measures)

New progression here: **Bm → D → F#m → C#**  
*(You can give each chord 1 measure/4 beats.)*

1. **Bm**  
   “E - ven in the **dark** - est night”  
   - *Melody idea*:
     - Start around B or D  
     - Slowly descend or swirl for “-est night”  

2. **D**  
   “I can **hear** the an - gels cry”  
   - *Melody idea*:
     - Move up on “hear” (F# or A)  
     - Soften on “angels cry”  

3. **F#m**  
   “Keep on **ri** - sing, keep on shi - ning bright”  
   - *Melody idea*:
     - Outline an F#m scale (F#–G#–A–B–C#)  
     - Hit a strong note on “bright”  

4. **C#**  
   “**Un** - til we see the morn - ing light”  
   - *Melody idea*:
     - Possibly jump up on “until”  
     - Resolve on C# or E♯  

5. **Bm**  
   “Ev - ‘ry **tear** is turned to gold”  

6. **D**  
   “In the **prom** - ise that we hold”  

7. **F#m**  
   “We **stand** to - geth - er, we sing for - ev - er”  

8. **C#**  
   “And **love** will nev - er let us go”  

> *Consider a **dynamic drop** at the start of the Bridge, then build back into a crescendo before returning to the final chorus.*  

---

## **[Chorus - Final]**

Repeat the **Chorus** progression **(D → E → F#m → C#)** maybe 2 times for a bigger ending. Feel free to **extend** lines, add **vocal ad libs**, or shift the melody up an octave to make it triumphant.

**Sample final lines** (with optional ad libs in parentheses):

1. **D**  
   “You’re my **light** up - on the wa - ter (my light, my light)”  

2. **E**  
   “When my **faith** is sink - ing fast (I’m never let go)”  

3. **F#m**  
   “You **re** - mind me I’m a daugh - ter/son”  

4. **C#**  
   “Of a **prom** - ise meant to last (forever and ever)”  

5. **D**  
   “Shine **through** all the shad - ows”  

6. **E**  
   “Let your **mer** - cy see me through”  

7. **F#m**  
   “I **sur** - ren - der to the won - der”  

8. **C#**  
   “Of a **love** I nev - er knew”  

*(End on a strong, open **F#m** if you want the “minor but hopeful” vibe, or resolve to **A** if you want a more “major” ending.)*

---

## **[Outro]** (Optional)

Repeat a soft **F#m → C# → D → Bm** loop with gentle “Oooh” or “La-la” vocals:

```
F#m          C#
   Oooh, light upon the water

D             Bm
   Oooh, carry me farther

F#m          C#
   Oooh, let me rest in wonder

D             Bm
   Safe in your arms
```

Fade out or end on **F#m** with a final strum/piano chord.

---

# **PERFORMANCE TIPS**

1. **Vocal Delivery**  
   - Keep verses more **intimate** and gentle.  
   - Build passion in the **Pre-Chorus**, letting your voice lift on key words like *“eyes,” “sky,” “ride.”*  
   - **Chorus**: Open up fully—**anthemic** style, as Coldplay often does. Add background “oohs” or second harmonies for lift.  

2. **Rhythm & Strumming**  
   - **Verses**: Simple down-strums or a lightly picked pattern.  
   - **Pre-Chorus**: Add energy—down-up strums or build percussion.  
   - **Chorus**: Full strums with slight accent on beats 2 & 4, letting chords ring to fill the space.  

3. **Instrumentation**  
   - Start with a **piano** or **acoustic guitar** plus a **light pad**.  
   - Introduce **drums/bass** in Pre-Chorus to drive momentum.  
   - Add **lead guitar** or a soaring synth line in the **Chorus** for that signature “arena” sound.

4. **Dynamic Contrast**  
   - Don’t be afraid to drop instruments out briefly (e.g., in the **Bridge**) to create drama before the final chorus.  

5. **Optional Melodic Embellishments**  
   - On repeated choruses, jump an octave or riff with small runs to differentiate from the first chorus.  
   - If you have backing vocalists, layer them in the final chorus.

**Enjoy performing “Light Upon the Water!”** These chord placements and melody guides should help you or your band know **how to play and sing** the tune. Feel free to modify the melody notes to suit your vocal range and style, keeping that classic uplifting Coldplay-inspired vibe!
