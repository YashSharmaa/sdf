# **Heaven in Our Eyes**  
*(Key of D Major; ~102 BPM; 4/4 time)*

---

## **CHORD PROGRESSIONS OVERVIEW**

- **Intro / Verse** (IV–V–vi–V in D):  
  G — A — Bm — A  
- **Pre-Chorus**:  
  Bm — A — G — A (each chord one measure)  
- **Chorus** (I–II–iii–II in D):  
  D — E — F#m — E  
- **Bridge**:  
  Bm — G — D — E  

*(Feel free to tweak the tempo or add passing chords to taste.)*

---

## **STRUMMING SUGGESTIONS**

- **Intro/Verse**:  
  - **Pattern**: All down strums, steady eighth notes (like “Something Just Like This” feel).  
  - **Count**: *1 + 2 + 3 + 4 +* on each chord, accenting beats 2 & 4 lightly.  

- **Pre-Chorus**:  
  - Continue down strums but **open** up slightly, maybe accent the first beat of each measure more strongly to heighten tension.  

- **Chorus**:  
  - Use **fuller** strums. A simple pattern could be **down, down, down-up, down-up** each measure, with the final down-up leading into the next chord.  

- **Bridge**:  
  - Consider starting quietly with single strums or arpeggios, then build to fuller strums as you near the final chorus.

## **[INTRO]**  
*(Instrumental loop on G – A – Bm – A, 2x)*  
```
G             A             Bm            A
| (Down strums) 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + | 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + | ...
```
*Optional simple lead riff (electric with reverb) mirroring something “bubbly” and atmospheric.*  

---

## **[VERSE 1]**  
*(Same chord loop as Intro: G – A – Bm – A, repeated for each line.)*

```
      G                  A
I’m walking through these city lights,
      Bm                     A
Wondering if there’s more to find.
      G                     A
A prayer beneath the neon signs,
      Bm                  A
Telling me to free my mind.

      G                    A
Sometimes I feel so far away,
      Bm                   A
I question all that I believe.
      G                         A
But then I hear a gentle voice that says
      Bm                 A
“Open your heart and you’ll see...”
```

---

## **[PRE-CHORUS]**  
*(4 measures: Bm – A – G – A)*  

```
Bm               A
  All the doubts fade in the sky
G               A
  When I lift my eyes to something higher
Bm              A
  I’m ready now to step into the light
G               A
  Love is pulling me closer
```

> *Build intensity; this is your lift into the chorus.*  

---

## **[CHORUS]**  
*(D – E – F#m – E, repeated for each line. Do 2 cycles total = 8 lines.)*

```
D            E
  'Cause we got heaven in our eyes
      F#m                  E
  Shining through this world tonight
D               E
  All our fears just vaporize
      F#m            E
  When faith and hope collide
D            E
  We got heaven in our eyes
     F#m               E
  A song that no one can deny
D               E
  Lift me up to paradise
      F#m             E
  And show me love that never dies
```

*(Repeat the chord loop 2 times for the entire chorus. The last line can lead right back to the verse loop.)*  

---

## **[VERSE 2]**  
*(Same as Verse 1: G – A – Bm – A)*  

```
G                       A
  I see a thousand shooting stars
       Bm               A
As the nighttime calls our names
G                          A
  In every heartbeat near or far
       Bm              A
We share the same refrain

G                       A
  We’re all searching for answers, 
       Bm                  A
We’re all praying for some grace
    G                    A
But hand in hand we come alive 
     Bm          A
In a love we can’t replace
```

---

## **[PRE-CHORUS 2]**  
*(Same progression: Bm – A – G – A)*  

```
Bm           A
  Even in my brokenness
G             A
  Light is shining, calling me onward
Bm             A
  Step by step, I feel it in my chest
G           A
  A promise I can’t resist
```

---

## **[CHORUS 2]**  
*(Same chords: D – E – F#m – E, x2 through the lines.)*

```
D            E
  'Cause we got heaven in our eyes
      F#m                  E
  Shining through this world tonight
D               E
  All our fears just vaporize
      F#m            E
  When faith and hope collide
D            E
  We got heaven in our eyes
     F#m               E
  A song that no one can deny
D               E
  Lift me up to paradise
      F#m             E
  And show me love that never dies
```

> *Second chorus can be bigger—add higher harmony, layered instrumentation.*  

---

## **[BRIDGE]**  
*(Bm – G – D – E, each chord for 1 measure.)*  
*Consider starting quietly, then build.*  

```
Bm                 G
  We rise up when we’re falling
D                     E
  The darkest night can’t keep us down
Bm                  G
  'Cause somehow faith keeps calling
D                     E
  A hidden joy that’s all around
```

*(Repeat Bridge chords once more for a second stanza or a short instrumental break.)*  

---

## **[CHORUS 3 / FINAL]**  
*(Same chord loop: D – E – F#m – E)*  

You can **repeat** or extend the chorus here. Feel free to add an ad-lib or a small vocal run:

```
D            E
  We got heaven in our eyes
F#m                    E
  A symphony of stars inside
D              E
  And I’m never letting go
       F#m          E
  Of this love that saves my soul
(repeat lines or ad-lib)
```

---

## **[OUTRO]**  
*(Softly return to G – A – Bm – A, perhaps 2 times, fading out.)*  

```
G         A         Bm        A
 (Quiet strums) 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 
G         A         Bm        A
 Heaven in our eyes... oh-oh...
```

Fade on a gentle chord or end with a single **D** chord (if you want a “home” resolution).

# **Performance & Production Notes**

1. **Vocals**  
   - **Verse**: Keep it intimate and reflective, as if softly sharing your journey.  
   - **Pre-Chorus**: Increase energy and melodic lift to signal the upcoming chorus.  
   - **Chorus**: Big, open vocals with a memorable hook. Harmonies (especially in the second/third chorus) can emphasize the uplifting vibe.  

2. **Instrumentation**  
   - Start with **acoustic guitar** or **piano** in the **Intro**/Verse for a warm, minimal feel.  
   - Add a **driving beat** (kick on 1, snare on 3, with a subtle hi-hat or claps on 2 & 4) as you near the **Pre-Chorus**.  
   - In the **Chorus**, layer **electric guitar/pad** for that wide “arena” sound. A subtle melodic riff on lead guitar or synth can recall those classic Coldplay lines.  

3. **Dynamics**  
   - **Build** from gentle in the first verse to **fully layered** in the final chorus.  
   - Consider a brief **drop-out** in the Bridge (just vocals + single strums) and then **explode** back into the final chorus.  

4. **Optional Hooks/Ad-Libs**  
   - End of each chorus can feature wordless “ooo” or “la-la-la” lines to complement the main lyric, giving that anthemic sing-along vibe.  
   - In the **Outro**, soft repeated phrases of “Heaven in our eyes” or “Oh-oh-oh” can drive home the celestial mood.

**Enjoy “Heaven in Our Eyes”**—an **original** composition inspired by the chordal and lyrical spirit of Coldplay’s style. Feel free to modify keys, structure, or specific melodic phrases to suit your personal range and the band’s sound. Go forth and make it a *hit!*
