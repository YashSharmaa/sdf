---

## **[INTRO]**

```
C    (let ring 2 bars)
```

- *Light single strum on **C**, letting it ring for the entire introduction. Optionally, you can arpeggiate the notes of the C chord with a soft fingerpicking pattern.*

---

## **[VERSE 1]**  
*(Each line uses **C → F/C → C**. Each chord typically lasts 2 beats, but you can experiment.)*

```
C                F/C               C
  I wake up slow to the golden sky
                   F/C             C
  A gentle light dancing on my mind
C             Gsus4       G
  And I can’t let go
C/E      Bbmaj9          G/B
  Of something I’ve come to know
```
- *Suggested melody approach (soft, conversational):*  
  - On “I wake up slow” start near the note E (the 3rd of C)  
  - Then lift on “golden sky”  
  - Lightly emphasize “can’t let go” with a slight upward turn in pitch  

```
C                F/C               C
  I sense a spark right beneath my skin
                F/C       C
  A new emotion pulling me in
               Gsus4   G
  Feels so close to home
C/E          Bbmaj9
  Never felt so less alone
```
- *Mirror or vary the melody from the first 4 lines. Keep it tender and floating.*

---

## **[PRE-CHORUS]**  
*(Progression: **F → C → G**, 2 cycles to complete lyric. Each chord can get 1 measure/4 beats.)*

```
F               C             G
  I hear your voice across the room
F            C            G
  Like the sunrise chasing gloom
```

- *Build tension with a slightly higher melody. Let the final “gloom” hang a bit, preparing for the chorus.*

---

## **[CHORUS]**  
*(One cycle of **G/B → C → G → Em**, then **F → G → F/A → G/B**. Repeat if you like. The lines below each correspond to 1 chord measure.)*

```
G/B    C                         G
Oh, it feels like love’s leading me on
          Em               F
Every wall I built is nearly gone
             G    F/A        G/B
And I’m losing myself in you
```
- *“Feels like love’s leading me on”: big, open vocal line. Land around G or A note for a triumphant feel.*  

```
   G/B    C                      G
It feels like a brand-new dawn
                 Em   F
Pulling me into something true
            G    F/A      G/B
And this is where I wanna stay
```
- *On “wanna stay,” let your voice float or do a small run.  This chord loop can be repeated for a longer chorus if desired.*  

---

## **[VERSE 2]**  
*(Same chords as Verse 1: **C → F/C → C**)*

```
C               F/C          C
  I'm learning all the ways you smile
             F/C             C
  How you whisper, how you shine
              Gsus4  G
  It's a hidden world
C/E           Bbmaj9    G/B
  Opening up inside my mind
```

```
C                  F/C        C
  I hear my heart beating in time
            F/C       C
  Guess I never knew the signs
                Gsus4  G
  But now it’s so clear
C/E          Bbmaj9
  I want your laughter near
```

---

## **[PRE-CHORUS 2]**  
*(Again, **F → C → G**, repeat for 2 lines.)*

```
F          C              G
  I’m on the edge of something bright
F             C               G
  With every breath, I feel the light
```

---

## **[CHORUS 2]**  
*(Same chords: **G/B → C → G → Em → F → G → F/A → G/B**)*  
You can **add** backing vocals or a melodic guitar line for extra lift.

```
G/B    C                         G
Oh, it feels like love’s leading me on
          Em               F
Every wall I built is nearly gone
             G    F/A        G/B
And I’m losing myself in you
   G/B    C                       G
It feels like a brand-new dawn
            Em          F
Hope is rising in everything I do
           G    F/A      G/B
And this is where I wanna stay
```

---

## **[BRIDGE]**  
*(Optional: you can **loop** the Pre-Chorus chords or do a new progression. For example: **Am – F – C – G** repeated. Below is a suggestion that fits the feel.)*

```
Am                   F
  Maybe I was locked behind a door
C                      G
  Afraid to let the feelings in
Am               F
  But you came close and showed me more
C                          G
  And taught me love was not a sin
```

- *Keep it soft at first, then build into the final chorus.*  

---

## **[CHORUS 3 / FINAL]**  
*(Repeat the **Chorus** progression. Feel free to do it **twice**. Add vocal ad libs or a second harmony.)*

```
G/B    C                         G
Oh, it feels like love’s leading me on
                Em         F
No more fear, now that you’re here
                 G     F/A   G/B
My heart’s where it belongs
    G/B       C                 G
It feels like I found my place
                 Em          F
In the warmth of your gentle grace
           G      F/A        G/B
Oh, this is where I wanna stay
           G
Where I wanna stay
```

- *End on a single strum of **C** (or let G/B resolve to C) for a gentle finish.*

   - **Gsus4** (3x0013), then resolve to **G** (320003)

2. **Strumming**  
   - **Verse**: Light down strums or gentle picking on the C and F/C chords.  
   - **Pre-Chorus**: Open up a bit—fuller down strums, maybe a slight build in volume.  
   - **Chorus**: Big, confident strums. This is the melodic “hook,” so give it energy.  

3. **Vocals**  
   - Keep the **Verse** intimate and personal.  
   - Let the **Pre-Chorus** climb in pitch and emotion, leading to the payoff in the **Chorus**.  
   - In the **Chorus**, deliver a more anthemic vocal. Add **backing harmonies** if available.  

4. **Dynamics**  
   - Optionally, do a small instrumentation breakdown at the **Bridge** (less percussion or just a pad under the vocals), then **burst** into the final chorus for a dramatic finish.  

5. **Style Enhancements**  
   - A **piano line** can softly outline chords in the verse.  
   - A **subtle lead guitar** or **synth** can add melodic fills around the vocal in the chorus.

**Enjoy playing “Where I Wanna Stay!”** It’s inspired by the same warm, heartfelt chord patterns and romantic vibe you heard in “Falling In Love,” giving you that slightly cinematic, uplifting Coldplay-esque feel. Adjust keys and melodies as needed for your range, and have fun making it your own!
